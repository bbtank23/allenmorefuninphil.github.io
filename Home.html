<p style = 'background:rgba(0,0,0,0.6); padding:20px;'>The Philippines is a country that is full of rich history. This section will talk about a brief history about the Philippines.</p>

	<p style = 'background:rgba(0,0,0,0.6); padding:20px;' >Migrations from the Indonesian archipelago and other places are thought to have contributed to the settlement of the Philippine archipelago at least 30,000 years ago. Over the next millennia, there were other migrations. The widely dispersed islands saw a development and evolution of social and political order over time. The barrio was the fundamental societal unit (a Malay word for boat that came to be used to denote a communal settlement). There were large social divides within the barangay, including aristocrats, freemen, dependent and landless agricultural labourers, and slaves. Kinship groupings were governed by a datu (chief). Chinese traders joined the Indo-Malay migration over the years. The introduction of Islam by traders and missionaries to the Philippines was a significant event during the early era.</p>

	<p style = 'background:rgba(0,0,0,0.6); padding:20px;'> The first European to be known to have set foot in the Philippines was Ferdinand Magellan. On his voyage around the world, he landed in March 1521. He attempted to claim territory for the Spanish king but was murdered by the local chief. After a number of more Spanish expeditions, Cebu's first permanent colony was founded in 1565. The Spanish established Manila as their capital in 1571 after overthrowing a local Muslim monarch, and they gave the colony King Philip II's name. By doing this, the Spanish hoped to increase their influence in the lucrative spice trade, establish closer ties with China and Japan, and convert people to Christianity. 
	Only the third goal was ultimately accomplished. Church and state merged together to carry out Spanish goals, much like in other Spanish colonies. So Spain converted the locals</p>

	<p style = 'background:rgba(0,0,0,0.6); padding:20px;'> José Rizal was a doctor, scientist, academic, and author. His works as a Propaganda Movement member—a group of intellectually engaged, upper-class Filipino reformers—had a significant influence on the emergence of the Filipino identity. His writings were outlawed, and he was forced into exile. In order to establish the Liga Filipina (Philippine League), a national, nonviolent political organization, Rizal returned from abroad in 1892. However, he was imprisoned and banished, and the league was disbanded. One outcome was the division of the nationalist movement between a more revolutionary and independence-minded plebeian constituency and the reform-minded ilustrados. Many of the latter joined the Katipunan, a covert organization dedicated to achieving national independence and established by Andres Bonifacio in 1892.</p>

	<p style = 'background:rgba(0,0,0,0.6); padding:20px;' >The First Philippine Republic and the United States engaged in an armed conflict that lasted from February 4, 1899, to July 2, 1902, known as the Philippine-American War[11] or the Filipino-American War (modern Filipino: Digmaang Pilipino-Amerikano), which the United States had previously referred to as the Philippine Insurrection or the Tagalog Insurgency. When the Spanish-American War came to an end in 1898, the United States refused to recognize the Philippines' declaration of independence and instead annexed the country under the terms of the Treaty of Paris. The conflict that followed can be seen as a continuation of the Philippine struggle for independence that started in 1896 with the Philippine Revolution against Spanish rule.</p>

	<p style = 'background:rgba(0,0,0,0.6); padding:20px;'> According to Marcos, martial law was the last line of defense against the rising unrest brought on by increasingly violent student protests, the alleged communist insurgency threats made by the newly formed Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), and the Muslim separatist movement of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF). Arresting opposition members in Congress and the Constitutional Convention was one of his first moves. Except for Muslim regions in the south, where a separatist rebellion led by the MNLF erupted in 1973, the general public's first response to martial law was favorable. Thousands of soldiers and civilians continued to die in the revolt despite feeble attempts to negotiate a cease-fire. Upon the establishment of the National Democratic Front, the Communist insurgency grew.</p>

<p> Fort Santiago is the oldest Spanish bastion in the Philippines. Situated inside the walled city of Intramuros in Manila, the site witnessed many historical events of the Philippines.

The exact spot where Fort Santiago now stands was once a Muslim kingdom ruled by a chieftain named Rajah Sulayman. When the Spaniards landed in the Philippines in 1571, they destroyed the site and built a fortress instead, naming it after Spain’s patron saint, Saint James (Santiago in Spanish). The structure served as their defense fortress. </p>

<p> Manila Cathedral is recognized as the main Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines. Located in the Plaza de Roma, Intramuros, its official name is Manila Metropolitan Cathedral-Basilica and is the seat of the Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Manila.
When Catholicism arrived in the Philippines in 1521, it brought with it the western church architecture. One of the most significant and magnificent churches built during the Spanish colonization is the Manila Cathedral. This church is only located at Intramuros! </p>

<p> 
Baluarte de San Diego is a spade-shaped bulwark located inside the historic district of Intramuros in Manila City. 
This fort was created from the remains of the upper portion of a circular watch tower built from 1586-1587.
Since it was erected, Baluarte de San Diego underwent a series of repairs and restorations after getting damaged during wars
 and an earthquake. The baluarte had been breached and fallen in 1762 during a battle with the British forces.

<p> In 1814, Mayon Volcano recorded its most violent eruption, completely burying the entire town of Cagsawa by fast-flowing volcanic matter, except for the belfry.

Set against the magnificent backdrop of its creator, Cagsawa Ruins Park is declared a national cultural treasure that brings visitors closer to the volcano. The site is just a short drive away from Daraga proper, and once you’ve arrived, several exhilarating Mayon Volcano tours await you, including the Mayon ATV tour around the foothills of Mount Mayon as well as awe-inspiring landscapes in the area.  </p>

<p style = 'background:rgba(0,0,0,0.6); padding:20px; margin:20px;'> The Visayas are a major island and cultural grouping in the midsection of the Philippines. Nearly every part of the region has some fine beaches along its coasts, some fine diving areas including many coral reefs teeming with life, and some interesting historic buildings, mostly from the Spanish colonial period, in the cities and some towns. Most of the larger islands have mountains near the center, most of them volcanic in origin though few are active now.

The country's best-known resort island, Boracay, is in the northwestern corner of the region. Diving destinations include Malapascua in Cebu Province, Panglao Island in Bohol Province, Apo Island in Negros Oriental, Danjugan Island in Negros Occidental, and many others. Other tourist draws include Metro Cebu which is the main urban center of the region, the Chocolate Hills of Carmen, Bohol, and whale watching in the Tañon Strait near Bais, Negros Oriental. </p>

Boracay Island, one of the top beaches in the Philippines and 
one of the best Visayas tourist spots, is blessed with a long stretch of powdery white sand beach (called White Beach), 
crystal clear and azure waters, a stunning sunset, 
and more. The island doesn’t fall short on adventures and activities for people of all ages.
<br>
<br>
You'll never run out of exciting things to do in Boracay, from swimming, island hopping in the Philippines, 
diving, snorkeling, parasailing, kayaking, dining, and parties. Because of these, Boracay has been cited multiple 
times as one of the best islands and beaches in the world according to reputable publications and travelers' choice lists.

The island province of Bohol in the Philippines may be smaller than its Visayan neighbors Cebu and Negros which are
home to some of the top tourist spots in Visayas and most beautiful islands in the Philippines, but it doesn't fall 
short of stunning sights and activities, such as its famous Chocolate Hills. 
<br>
<br>

Joining Chocolate Hills tours will treat you to a breathtaking view of a thousand beautiful cone-shaped hills 
stretched over 50 square kilometers of land across the towns of Carmen, Batuan, and Sagbayan. This is the tourist 
spot that put Bohol on the map of top tourist destinations in the Philippines, and that has baffled many geologists.

Kawasan Falls is the magnificent set of cascades that draw thousands of visitors to Cebu 
Island. Kawasan is one of the top Cebu tourist spots because of its lush surroundings and 
striking turquoise water. 
<br><br>
Visitors from all over visit Kawasan to enjoy its raw beauty and serene landscape. 
It is a great spot for swimming as the water is remarkably clean and refreshing. The water
 that flows through the waterfalls is part of the Matutinao River System. This system is 
 highly regarded for having one of the cleanest inland body of water in the Philippine Islands. 
<br><br>
The waterfall has two main tiers, which feature natural pools perfect for swimming. 
The first tier stands at about 40 meters. The second tier is only around 20 meters 
and is often less visited because people need to trek for 10 minutes from the first cascade to reach it.

<p style = 'background:rgba(0,0,0,0.6); padding:20px; margin:20px;'> Being the second largest island group next to Luzon, Mindanao has been dubbed the country's “Land of Promise” because of its promising natural resources.

There is probably no other river in the country that will surpass the blueness of the famous
 Enchanted River, another mystic gem nestled in Hinatuan town in Surigao del Sur. It is 290 
 meters long, but its depth remains a mystery for many divers. 
 <br><br>
There were diving expeditions made in the past, yet there is no clear picture of what lies at the 
bottommost part of the mystical river. With water flowing to the Philippine Sea and the Pacific Ocean,
 the Hinatuan Enchanted River opens up to an estuary where salt water mixes with the river’s spring water.
 <br><br>
The famous blue river is only a small portion of it. Divers even found an opening 
of an underwater cave at the river’s deepest portion. To preserve its beauty, visitors
 are not allowed to swim in the main pool. There is a designated area for swimming, 
 which is only 10 meters away from the main pool.

<p style =  'background:rgba(0,0,0,0.6); padding:20px'>
Towering over Southern Mindanao, Mount Apo is the highest mountain 
in the Philippines located in the Durian Capital of 
the country, Davao. It rises over 2,956 MASL and covers 
the provinces of Davao del Sur and North Cotabato. 
<br><br>

Mount Apo features mossy forests, swamps, and volcanic structures. It possesses an array of lush landscapes
 that mountaineers can pass through by following the Kidapawan-Magpet Trail. When hiking Mount Apo, you
 must consider its difficulty level of 7/9 that requires a major climb.

<p style =  'background:rgba(0,0,0,0.6); padding:20px'>
Dubbed as the first-ever pink mosque in the Philippines, Masjid Dimaukom or 
The Pink Mosque is a Maguindanao centerpiece constructed in 2013 to become the 
new image and representation of the province. The sacred building is the initiative
 of Mayor Samsudin Dimaukom of the Datu Saudi Ampatuan town who happens to have 
 chosen pink as his favorite color.
 
 <br><br>

Pink represents peace, harmony, and love. Likewise, 
the people of Datu Saudi Ampatuan believe that the mosque
 will bring them unity and brotherhood. Inspired by the mosque’s 
 color and design, the town’s municipal hall, police stations, and 
 public market are also set to be repainted pink. When you enter the town, 
 you will also be greeted by the pink flags lined on the sidewalks.
